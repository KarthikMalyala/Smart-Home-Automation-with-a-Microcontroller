# Smart-Home-Automation-with-a-Microcontroller
This is an embedded system project using an ATMega328PB Xplained Mini to effectively turn a light switch on/off wirelessly from a mobile device. Assembly and C languages were used to program the ATMega328PB board to receive commands from a mobile app programmed in Java. The hardware components used were the microcontroller (ATMega 328PB), SG90 microservo, HC-05 Bluetooth Module, LEDs, and Resistors. Several concepts like Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (USART), Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Timers/Counters, Output Compare Registers, Baud Rate, and more were used to complete this project.
